<p>Young Tech Feds started to connect recent grads from different agencies who don't often see other young people at work. 
  It's grown to include RAs, Analysts, Paralegals, Technologists, Staffers and more from several agencies, EOP, and Congress.
  We're focused on folks working on or using technology but welcome all federal employees! </p>
